# FPT Job Match

## Description:
The FPT Job project was initiated as an assignment in Application Development subject at my University, with the goal of creating an innovative job search website that connects job seekers with online employers. Our team, consisting of two members, utilized ASP.Net for the backend, ReactJS for the frontend, and SQL Server for database storage to build a robust and user-friendly platform. In this project, I primarily focused on backend development, crafting APIs for the frontend to interact with and process data seamlessly.

After successfully completing the course, I expanded the project by developing an Android application using Flutter and Dart. This mobile application was designed to deliver a smooth user experience, connecting directly to the ASP.NET API. I implemented design patterns such as Repository and MVVM to enhance code structure and optimize data management. State management is efficiently handled through GetX, ensuring real-time synchronization and ease of use.

Additionally, the application features the ability to store favorite job listings using SQLite, enabling users to quickly access positions they are interested in. To safeguard user information, tokens are securely stored using Secure Storage.
